# Cmder Cheat Sheet

### Grep History

Cmder has an alias for history.

```console
history=cat "%CMDER_ROOT%\config\.history"
```

But you can't `grep` against the alias, e.g.

```console
history | grep "docker run"
```

Instead you must use the content of the `doskey` macro.

> In Cmder::Cmder sessions history is a doskey macro. The output of a macro cannot be passed using the pipe | but you could use the command that is the content of the doskey macro as shown below:

```console
C:\Users\user\cmder
Î» cat %CMDER_ROOT%\config\.history | grep cmder
```
